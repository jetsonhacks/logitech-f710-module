# logitech-f710-module

Support for the Logitech F710 game controller on NVIDIA Jetson Developer Kits. This enables the Logitech F710 to operate in Direct Input mode (selector D on the back of the controller).

> **JetPack 6 Note:**  
> Starting with JetPack 6, the Logitech F710 support must be built directly into the kernel (`LOGITECH_FF` must be enabled as a built-in feature). This means the module (`hid-logitech.ko`) cannot be installed as a separate external module as with previous releases.  
> 
> A new `JetPack6` directory in this repository contains instructions for installing the full kernel `Image` with built-in F710 support where available.

---

## Overview

This repository provides:

- Prebuilt `hid-logitech.ko` modules for earlier JetPack versions
- Scripts to build the module from kernel sources
- JetPack 6 support via full kernel replacement

---

## install-module (JetPack 5 and earlier)

To install the provided `hid-logitech.ko` module:

```bash
$ ./install-module.sh
```

After installation, **cold boot** the Jetson device.

---

## build-module (JetPack 5 and earlier)

This script outlines how to build the Logitech kernel module. It expects kernel sources in `/usr/src`.

```bash
# For Kernel 5.x (Ubuntu 20+), install dependencies:
$ sudo apt install libssl-dev

# Then build:
$ ./build-module.sh
```

This script enables the `LOGITECH_FF` option and builds the module.

After the build, the module will be located in the source tree.  
Example for kernel 4.9:  
`/usr/src/kernel/kernel-4.9/drivers/hid/hid-logitech.ko`

---

## JetPack 6 Instructions

As of JetPack 6, external modules are no longer supported for this use case.  
You must install the kernel `Image` with Logitech support built-in.

Please see the `jetpack-6/` directory in this repository for full instructions.

---

## Testing

After installation, test the controller with:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install jstest-gtk
# The Logitech F710 typically appears at /dev/input/js0
$ jstest /dev/input/js0
```

---

## Notes

To build from source, youâ€™ll need to download and extract the BSP source for your Jetson model. This repository contains convenience scripts to help with setup.
